        <h3>Instructions: guided manual scoring via random intratumoral circles</h3>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Please scan the slide of interest using Aperio scanner</li>
            <li>Please use Aperio ImageScope to open the virtual slide file (*.svs).
                <ul>
                    <li>Mark/select the tumor area using annotation pen tool, rectangle tool or ellipse tool.</li>
                    <li>Please note: <b>negative pen tool NOT supported</b></li>
                    <li>Please save the annotation file (using the default name)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>This application will then generate five intratumoral circles (virtual TMA cores), randomly distributed among the selected tumor area(s).  
                Please count 100 tumor nuclei from each of the five intratumoral circles (i.e. a total of 500 nuclei for five intratumoral circles).
                Please note: if during the scoring if at least one of the intratumoral circles has less than 100 tumor nuclei, please count all tumor nuclei on
                the current circle and proceed to the next circle.  You can safely ignore the message to ask you to score from the top/bottom of the circle since all
                tumor nuclei on this particular circle will be counted.  Additional random intratumoral circle(s) will be generated until at least 500 nuclei is counted.
            </li>
            <li>This application will then assess the heterogeneity of the Ki67 expression based on the scores (i.e. positive/negative nuclei count) on the 
                five intratumoral circles.  Sufficiently high heterogeneity will trigger (up to 20) additional intratumoral circles being generated and presented 
                for scoring.  Each core would require 100 tumor nuclei being counted in the same fashion as the initial five.
            </li>
            <li>System requirements
                <ul>
                    <li>Windows XP or higher</li>
                    <li>Aperio ImageScope (version 12 or higher)</li>
                    <li>Minimum screen resolution: 1024 x 768</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Please verify all system requirements and perform all tasks mentioned above.  
                When you are ready, please click on the "OK" button below to continue.  
                You will be asked to select the Aperio virtual slide file (*.svs).</li>
